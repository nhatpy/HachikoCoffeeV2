- Because main repository is containing secret_key for payment service (PayOS) and connect_key to database (MongoDB), so I have cloned that repository for my recruiment process (scan project, I think so).
- This is just backend repository (my role in CV), if you want to get more information about my team project, you should check pinned project - HachikoCoffeeV2 on my github profile later.
- Teamsize: 4
- Additionally, this is just clone repository, you can't check project contributor, so I'm going to attach their profile below:
