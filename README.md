# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Run the emulator

With flutter installed, run the following command to start the emulator:
```bash
flutter emulators --launch [emulator_id]
```

Example:
```bash
flutter emulators --launch Pixel_4_XL_API_34
```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Cloudinary Setup

This application uses Cloudinary for image uploads. Follow these steps to configure your Cloudinary account:

1. Create a Cloudinary account at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Go to your Dashboard to get your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret
3. Create an upload preset:
   - Go to Settings > Upload
   - Scroll down to "Upload presets" and click "Add upload preset"
   - Set the preset name to "hachiko_uploads" (or update the code to match your preferred name)
   - Configure your preset settings (optional):
     - Set "Mode" to "Signed" for more security
     - Enable auto-tagging, moderation, or other features as needed
     - Configure transformation options as needed
   - Save the preset

4. Update your environment variables:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

### Using the Image Uploader

The application includes a reusable `ImageUploader` component:

```jsx
import ImageUploader from '../components/ImageUploader';

// In your component:
<ImageUploader 
  onImageUploaded={(imageData) => console.log(imageData)}
  folder="your_folder_name"
  width={300}
  height={300}
  placeholder="Tap to upload an image"
/>
```

You can also access the Cloudinary utilities directly using the `useCloudinary` hook:

```jsx
import { useCloudinary } from '../hooks/useCloudinary';

// In your component:
const { 
  pickAndUploadImage, 
  takePhotoAndUpload, 
  getImage, 
  removeImage,
  isUploading,
  uploadProgress,
  uploadError
} = useCloudinary();

// Use these functions to manage images
```

A full example is available at `/app/cloudinary-example.tsx`
